Planbox Product Management Dashboard
=================================

If you're like us, you keep a list of potential improvements your Planbox initiatives. However, deciding which items to work on next is a product management challenge, and Planbox doesn't really provide the tools needed to make informed decisions and easily manage/schedule the work.

We've started managing our high-level features in a special "Product Management" project inside Planbox, which gives a great top-level view of the organizational priorities. To keep all the data in a single place, this product management app uses a special suite of labels to store product management data.

Our product management prioritization process uses the following attributes:

* Potential revenue
* Strategic fit -- does the idea match up with the long-term product vision?
* Estimated Time to build
* Build Risk -- what's the risk on the build side? Might it take way longer than originally guessed?

How to use:

1. Log in to your planbox (use Safari if you're running this app from a local filesystem)
1. Edit app.js's "constants" to match your Planbox's product_id and the project_id from your "Product Management" project.
1. Load the app, and score each product idea on all attributes.
